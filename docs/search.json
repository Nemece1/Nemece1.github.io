    "text": "This is Understanding Medications: Uncovering Side Effects.\n\nThe past year and a half I have been studying the essential skills in R such as Data visualization, tidying, transformation. Over this time I have practiced my coding skills using joins, factors, strings and other workflow basics. In the fall of 2023 Jackson Marsh and I conducted a study on the side effects of popular prescription drugs and the cautions of drug interactions."
